# Autonomous RC Car 
## Bates Raspberry Pi Short Term Class 2017


### May 3 2017
This is the first day we have really begun to work on the project. The goal for today was to take apart the RC car we bought and begin to understand how it works. Because some of our parts were still in the mail we spent a good portion of the day reading tutorials and working with OpenCV. By the end of the session our Pi's camerea could recognize faces using OpenCv.

Since our last update we have ordered all the parts and successfully taken apart the car. We have taken apart the car so we can control both the motor that turns the front wheels, and the motor that controls forward and reverse.

Our next goal is to setup our Raspberry Pi to the Bates network. Once that is done we are following this tutotial to control our car using a blue tooth keyboard.

Once we took apart the car we started to hookup the L298D chip to the motors and batteries from the car.

As today wraps up our goals are to connect the bluetooth keyboard and the pi to the car. Most of our wires are now set up and good to go. 







Notes: We are being extremely careful to label and track all the screws we are using. Each RC car is different...to do this project we need to be careful with the car and its parts since there is no clear way to take it apart and put it back together. When playing with the batteries becareful with the livewires...if the batter isn't disconnected this could cause a spark'
