Semi-autonomous RC Car
5/3/17:
Today our toy RC car arrived.  We sucessfully configured the toy car and were able to drive it (forwards, backwards, left, right)
Still waiting on L298N - H dual driver chip and raspberry Pi
When these parts arrive, we will begin to hack the RC car and be able to control is movement from our computers via ssh.  
Eventually we will write a python script that controls the car based on openCV and object detection.

We hooked up the camera module to our raspberry pi and ran a simple face detection script using OpenCV.  The script was sucessful
and was able to detect a face when placed in front of our camera.

Next step is to adust/train openCV to recognize desired objects (road lines/stop signs)
This can be done by uploading an .xml file with a number of positive and negative samples
